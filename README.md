# Connector Namespaces

> Connect your AI agents and workloads to the apps you already use.

**🌐 Portal: [connectors.azure.com](https://connectors.azure.com)**

Connector Namespaces is a Microsoft Azure service that lets you bring connectors into your own namespace and use them with AI agents, Logic Apps, and other workloads — with the security, governance, and lifecycle controls your organization expects.

## Status

🚧 This repository is being set up. Content, samples, and documentation will be added shortly.

## Skills for Coding Agents

This repo doubles as a plugin marketplace for GitHub Copilot CLI and Claude Code.
Install the skills once and drive Azure Connectors from natural language inside
your coding agent.

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Requires GitHub Copilot CLI **1.0.58 or later** (run `copilot update` if needed):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Azure/Connectors
/plugin install azure-connectornamespace@Azure-Connectors
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin add Azure/Connectors
```

### Available skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [azure-connectornamespace](plugin/skills/connectors/SKILL.md) | Generic, callback-agnostic — manage connector namespaces, connections, trigger configs that POST to any HTTP(S) callback (Function App, Logic App, App Service, custom webhook), and MCP server configs that expose connector operations as MCP tools. |
| [azure-connectornamespace-aca-sandbox](plugin/skills/aca-sandboxes/SKILL.md) | ACA-sandbox edition — manage connector namespaces, connections, and triggers; wire external services (Office 365, Teams, Forms, SharePoint, OneDrive, GitHub, Azure Blob) to Azure Container Apps sandbox apps via event-driven triggers or direct API calls using connection runtime URLs. |

See [`plugin/skills/connectors/README.md`](plugin/skills/connectors/README.md) for more detail.
